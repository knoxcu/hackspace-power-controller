# Case

All measurements in mm and stated as L x W x D

* Yun + PCB = 70 x 85 x 10
* RFID = 62 x 82 x ?
* LCD = 37 x 116 x ?
* Buttons = 8 x 20

Modelling the layout led to a case size of 280 x 120 x 90mm.
But these dimensions didn't yield many cases! So I looked for some common sizes
and found some that were 240 x 120 x 100mm. Setting the openscad case dimensions
to these figures allowed me to move things about to check fit.
